Moving while your computer is connected to Internet is becoming
increasingly important to today's mobile people. Mobile IP is a
solution for maintaining connections and providing a transparent
access to mobile user's home network when the user is roaming in other
networks.

Dynamics - HUT Mobile IP is a hierarchical and dynamical solution for
Mobile IP. The aim of the hierarchical solution is, among others, to
provide faster location updates. This document gives instructions and
pointers for information for installing, configuring and
troubleshooting the Dynamics - HUT Mobile IP software.

1. Introduction

1.1 What is Mobile IP anyway?

The IETF Mobile IP Working Group Charter says:

"The Mobile IP Working Group has developed routing support to permit IP
nodes (hosts and routers) using either IPv4 or IPv6 to seamlessly
"roam" among IP subnetworks and media types. The Mobile IP method
supports transparency above the IP layer, including the maintenance of
active TCP connections and UDP port bindings. Where this level of
transparency is not required, solutions such as DHCP and dynamic DNS
updates may be adequate and techniques such as Mobile IP not needed."

A concrete example: 

In a Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11) environment that supports Mobile IP,
you can turn on your a mobile host with Mobile IP software and connect
to your home network on the other side of the globe. You can also move
around in the WLAN and maintain the sessions. Additionally, hosts in
the Internet would think that your host is located in your home network.

The basic Mobile IP is defined in RFC 2002. For more information about
Mobile IP, see chapter 7.


1.2 What is Dynamics - HUT Mobile IP?

The Dynamics - HUT Mobile IP system, developed at Helsinki University
of Technology (HUT), is a dynamical and hierarchical Mobile
IPv4 software for Linux operating system.

The software consists of three independent daemon executables: Home
Agent, Foreign Agent and Mobile Node (ha, fa and mn respectively).


1.3 What is this document about?

In this document we give basic instructions for installing the
Dynamics HUT Mobile IP system. Some information about configuration of
the Linux kernel and each of the system elements (the daemons) is also
available in this document.

This document also gives pointers to other important Dynamics system
and general Mobile IP documentation.

If you have problems with Dynamics system and you cannot solve them
with this document or with the other software documentation, feel free
to contact the authors at dynamics@cs.hut.fi.



2. Preparing your Linux kernel for Mobile IP

2.1 Required kernel configuration	

There are several kernel options listed in the README document's
REQUIREMENTS chapter that should be configured to make the system
work. These options are mainly IP routing and tunneling related
settings.



3. Installing the software

The README document and the INSTALL document delivered with the
software distribution provide installation instructions for the source
code distribution. Help for installing the RPM or DEB package can be
found from the respective HOWTO documents, for example RPM-HOWTO.


3.1 How to enable wireless extensions support in Dynamics MN?

If you have a WaveLAN card with Linux driver that supports IWSPY
ioctls, Dynamics can take an advantage of the wireless extensions
(monitor part). This is handy when you have a laptop-MN and FA(s) with
WaveLAN cards. With wireless extensions roaming between FAs is more
robust and provides glitchless handoff (if link quality is good
enough). Monitor monitors the heard FA's agent advertisements and
prioritizes them according to the quality of the link to the FA.

- Card & Driver

    First you need the card and driver combination that supports IWSPY
    ioctls. At the moment IWSPY-ioctls are supported in the Lucent's
    IEEE WaveLAN card with Andreas Neuhaus' driver 

	URL: http://www.fasta.fh-dortmund.de/users/andy/wvlan/ 
    
    You need the pcmcia subsystem sources 

	URL: http://hyper.stanford.edu/HyperNews/get/pcmcia/home.html

    to compile the driver. Read the wvlan.README for help. Notice that
    you need to add support for Lucent's WaveLAN card into pcmcia
    configuration files (if not already there):
    
    /etc/pcmcia/config:

	card "Lucent Technologies WaveLAN/IEEE Adapter"
	  version "Lucent Technologies", "WaveLAN/IEEE"
	  bind "wvlan_cs"

    /etc/pcmcia/config.opts:
    
    	module "wvlan_cs" opts "eth=0x1 channel=3 port_type=3 \
        network_name=test mtu=1500"

    If you want to verify that the driver has been successfully
    installed and the IWSPY is supported try to use iwspy(8). It is
    included in the wireless_tools package (see the homepage for the
    Andreas Neuhaus' driver above). Alternatively you can use MN and
    dynmn_tool (look below).

- Kernel configuration

    An additional option for the wireless extensions: Wireless LAN
    (non-hamradio) (CONFIG_NET_RADIO)

- MN 

    With dynmn_tool you can see if wireless extensions are working. With
    list command quality parameter should appear to each FA heard at
    the wireless side. You may also try the command "wireless
    channel".



4. Configuring the Dynamics - HUT Mobile IP

The software distribution includes configuration files for all the
system elements. These configuration files are intended to provide a
working test configuration for a simple private address test network.

The configuration parameters and their default values are explained in
the example configuration files and in the configuration manual pages
(dynhad.conf.5, dynfad.conf.5, and dynmnd.conf.5).
(See 'man dynhad.conf' ; 'man dynfad.conf', and 'man dynmnd.conf')

The dynamics_config_checklist document available with the software
distribution tries to address the most typical problematic
configuration issues. We strongly recommend that you read the
checklist carefully through and check your configuration files against
the instructions in the checklist!



5. Performance tips

A basic Mobile IP does handoffs based on timeouts. This results in a
glitch or pause in sessions when moving from FA to FA, especially in
wireless environments. One of the key objectives with this version of
the Mobile IP is to obtain fast handoffs for glitchless multimedia
streaming.

Basically, there are two areas where this version exceeds what the basic
Mobile IP offers. One is that we can configure hierarchies of Foreign
Agents. This localizes location updates and provides a significant
reduction in the latency usually experienced with Mobile IP location
updates.

The other is the support for signal-based wireless FA selection. When
using the IEEE 802.11 WLAN as the link level technology in the visited
network, we can set wireless policies for the Mobile Node so that with
the IWSPY-ioctl-enabled drivers (currently with Andreas Neuhaus's GPL
driver for the Lucent's IEEE WLAN-adapters) the MN selects the FA with
the strongest signal and does a handoff to that. Configuring both of
the above, we can obtain a significant improvement in the Mobile IP
performance so that glitchless multimedia streaming becomes possible.

IWSPY and signal-based wireless FA selection helps especially in
environments using IEEE 802.11 IBSS ("ad-hoc mode"). In these
networks, Dynamics MN may hear multiple FAs simultaneously and select
the best FA using a configured policy. In IEEE 802.11 BSS ("managed
mode") where each AP has exactly one FA reachable, Dynamics MN's
handoff policy "Newest-ADV" can result in better handoffs. This policy
can be set with dynmn_tool's command "policy Newest-ADV on". In
addition, you need to have a wireless LAN driver supporting wireless
extensions and to configure AP handoff polling ("APPollingInterval" in
dynmnd.conf).

Linux kernel has a configurable minimum time before the routing table
cache is flushed and the routing entry changes are taken into use. The
boot time default value is two seconds, which means that it takes two
seconds before the routing entry change really happens. This value
limits the data throughput noticeably when an MN is moving quickly
(e.g. changing its FA about once per second). The minimal flushing
time can be changed by writing the new value to
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/min_delay.
(e.g., "echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/min_delay").



6. FAQ and troubleshooting hints

What are those strange modes anyway?

- In Mobile IP, the Home Agent (HA) routes packets to the Mobile Node (MN)
  via a care-of-address (COA). This is a public address in the visited
  network. We have a mode where the MN carries the COA, that is,
  the co-located COA mode, or such where the FA contains the COA.
  In the former case, the tunnel towards the MN stops at the
  MN, in the latter it stops at the FA. Therefore, these modes are referred
  to as MN decapsulation, or FA decapsulation, respectively. In the MN
  decapsulation, there usually is no interaction with FAs at all, and the
  tunnel goes from the HA directly to the MN. However, it should noted that
  our implementation tries (if not told otherwise) to register through FAs
  even with the MN decapsulation in order to make use of the FA hierarchy and
  localized location updates.

- In the RFC 2002 only mode, packets from the MN to the other end (to the
  Corresponding node, or CN), go untunneled, and we have the "triangle" mode.
  This name comes from the fact that packets from the CN to the MN go via
  HA, but return directly forming the three edges of a triangle. However,
  because firewalls do not usually accept packets from strange addresses, and
  packets in FA decapsulation mode from the MN home address to the CN come
  from the visited network, they might be dropped. Therefore, an extension
  mode was introduced in the RFC 2344, that is, the Reverse Tunneling. In it,
  the packets from the MN to the CN also go tunneled via the HA.

What is a good mode to start with?

- Try FA decapsulation and reverse tunneling. After having succeeded with
  one mode, it will be easier to get the other modes working. Use the
  following option in the dynmnd.conf:

  EnableFADecapsulation TRUE

  If you use the signal-based handoff, you can set the lifetime relatively
  long at HA to preserve bandwidth. However, for the MN to hear the FAs,
  put the beacon times short (once in 2-5 seconds).

How do I use the Windows NT Mobile IP with this?

- With the RoamIn (see http://www.ikv.de), you can use Windows NT with
  the system by using the FA decapsulation mode. Use the following at the FA:

  EnableFADecapsulation TRUE
  EnableTriangleTunneling TRUE
  ForceReverseTunneling TRUE
  EnableReverseTunneling TRUE

  In the HA, put the lifetime short, since you can use the timeout-based
  handoff only with the Windows NT.

What are good debugging tools when problems arise?

- First, try the debugging tools in the package, i.e. the dynha_tool, the
  dynfa_tool, and the dynmn_tool. From their command line, type st 1 to get
  continuous display of status. Try the help command or see manual pages
  for more details.
- To check the tunnels, routes, or rules, the packet 'iproute2' is needed.
  You can get it for example from ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/Linux/ip-routing/.
- To see network traffic, you can use the tcpdump tool.
  You can get it from ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump-3.4.tar.Z
- To debug the operation of the daemons more thoroughly, use the debugging
  options. Those are explained in the debug_flags document in the doc
  directory of the source code distribution.
- Try to observe the syslogs of the daemon computers to find out error
  messages form the daemons.

Do we need to manually connect MN to HA on startup?

- Not anymore, at least in the FA decapsulation mode. With MN decapsulation
  the used address must be changed by some external entity (see below).

What kind of Care of Addresses are supported automatically?

- The FA COA is supported, since this is obtained from the agent advertisement.

- The MN COA, aka. co-located COA is not, since that is usually obtained
  from an external entity, e.g. a DHCP client. After updating such a COA,
  the external entity should trigger the MN to use that new address
  by issuing a dynmn_tool update.
- Note that when you are at the foreign network and using the co-located
  COA, you must configure the outer interface using the COA. Once this
  has been done e.g. by the DHCP client, you can notify the MN by issuing
  dynmn_tool update.

Why does the Foreign Agent need a RSA key? Can't it run without it?

- Yes it could, but only by configuring security associations between
  the FA and its signaling partners (other FAs, or HA). Version 0.6, however,
  still requires, that the RSA public key file is generated even if it would
  not be needed.
- If no security association exists with another FA in the
  hierarchy OR with a HA corresponding to a visiting MN, RSA
  encryption is used.
- If a security association does exist, the keyed MD5 algorithm
  is used.
- All this does not, however, prevent the FA to be used with any "dumb"
  RFC 2002 conforming HA.

Do we need the LocalAddressMN, or LocalAddressFAHA FA configuration
parameters?

- No, they are obsolete since v0.5.

What COA is shown in dynfa_tool's show command?

- The address is the IP address of the lower agent (another FA or the MN). This
  may differ from the COA shown by dynha_tool or dynmn_tool (the IP address 
  of the highest FA).

Do we need to start the mobility agents at the directories containing
their configuration files?

- Not anymore. The agents read the configuration files by default from /etc
  if taken from binary packages or from /usr/local/etc when compiled from
  sources. See the source INSTALL instructions if you want to change the
  default path for the configuration files. You can also set the configuration
  file path with command line argument --config <file name>.

What could cause errors in deregistration when the MN returns home?

- Linux kernel has a possibility to filter packets that seem to come from
  wrong interface. If there is a tunnel to the MN and a non-encapsulated packet
  arrives at the HA (when the MN returns home, it sends deregistration message
  to the HA), the kernel would then drop the packet. This filter is not actived
  automatically when the kernel boots, but e.g. Debian 2.1's network setup
  scripts activate the filter. It must not be activated in the HA for the
  interface that is attached to the network that the MN would use at home.
  The filter can be deactivated with command like
  'echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/rp_filter'

When I compile the agents from the sources, why don't my configuration
files at /etc work?

- In the source package the default configuration file directory is
  /usr/local/etc, while in the binary packages it is /etc.
  The make install always replaces those at /usr/local/etc with
  the default configuration files. Even if you have symbolic links
  there pointing to files at /etc, you get the symlinks replaced by the
  default configuration files.
