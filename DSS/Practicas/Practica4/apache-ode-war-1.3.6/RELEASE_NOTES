Apache ODE Release Notes
========================

Apache ODE 1.3.6 includes about 42 bug fixes and improvements.

Apache ODE 1.3.6 requires Java 1.5.x or higher. The WAR distribution can 
run in most J2EE servlet containers. The JBI distribution should be able 
to run in any JBI container but has only been tested with ServiceMix 3.x
and latest ServiceMix 4.5.x (OSGi bundle) so far. See the BUILDING file if you 
want to build your own distribution from the source release. 

The most notable improvements:
  - Alignment with ServiceMix 4.5.x
  - Show a warning if datasources/TX mgrs are not correctly configured
  - Upgrade to Axis2 1.5.6 / Rampart 1.5.2
  - Fairer job scheduling / more reliable under load
  - Namespace declarations are now retained correctly in assigns
  - Integer to string conversion in XPath 1.0 fixed (found via Betsy)
  - Foreach completion condition is now implemented (found via Betsy)
  - Termination handlers are now implemented
  - Some minor Betsy complaints (foreach boundary checks, partnerlink
    assignments, rethrow fault data) addressed
